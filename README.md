## Mahjong

[Play Online](https://rblsb.github.io/Mahjong/)

Riichi mahjong demo, very nice classic board game.

Implemented things:
- Hand game cycle
- Bot AI to build closed hands ([based on this article](http://mahjongjoy.com/mahjong_bots_ai_algorithm.shtml))
- Player melds
- Win condition for all hand types
- Way to replay game with same wall for debugging

Would be nice to do someday:
- Hand points counter
- Rounds, hints
- Rewrite everything to start to undestand
- Optimize drawcalls

To undertand game rules i would recommend to check interactive tutorial on https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com.
